<h2>Welcome to the zyBooks zip file extractor and file renamer.</h2>

<p>This app was built out of frustration with the download format of the zyBooks assignment downloads.</p>

<p><b>Usage:</b></p>
<p>Select an assignment folder using the folder icon in the main window. The zipRenamer app will examine <b><i>ALL</i></b> subfolders for zip files.</p>
<p>It assumes that there is a single Python file in each zip file, which it will rename to use either the student's name, the student'n name and email or the entire filename string. The choice of these is made in the preferences dialog accessed via the gear icon on the main screen.

<p>You can also choose to remove the zip files when you are done using this dialog screen.</p><br>

<p>If you have any questions, want to report bugs or wish to add 'features' you can contact me at <a href="mailto:a.fieheart@snhu.edu">a.fieheart@snhu.edu</a></p>

I hope that this app will make your grading experience easier and faster!<br>
